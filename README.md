# multi-tenant-web-app
A prototype for a multi-tenant web app using React, Node.js, and MySQL. It follows a "single-database-with-multiple-schemas" model, isolating tenant data within separate schemas in one MySQL database. The project includes Docker for MySQL and basic tenant handling functionality.
